[00:16.22] I'm gonna fight 'em all
[00:19.65] A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
[00:23.96] They're gonna rip it off
[00:27.50] Taking their time right behind my back
[00:31.76] And I'm talking to myself at night
[00:34.47] Because I can't forget
[00:40.01] Back and forth through my mind
[00:42.18] Behind a cigarette
[00:51.18] 
[00:47.16] And the message coming from my eyes
[00:50.22] Says, "Leave it alone"
[01:01.22] 
[01:26.77] Don't wanna hear about it
[01:30.49] Every single one's got a story to tell
[01:34.54] Everyone knows about it
[01:38.08] From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell
[01:42.46] And if I catch it coming back my way
[01:45.28] I'm gonna serve it to you
[01:50.65] And that ain't what you want to hear
[01:53.00] But that's what I'll do
[02:04.50] 
[01:58.05] And the feeling coming from my bones
[02:00.83] Says, "Find a home"
[02:10.33] 
[02:53.23] I'm going to Wichita
[02:56.86] Far from this opera forevermore
[03:01.05] I'm gonna work the straw
[03:04.55] Make the sweat drip out of every pore
[03:09.07] And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
[03:12.10] Right before the Lord
[03:16.78] All the words are gonna bleed from me
[03:19.37] And I will think no more
[03:31.37] 
[03:24.47] And the stains coming from my blood
[03:27.35] Tell me, "Go back home"

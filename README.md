```lrc
[00:09.33] I'm gonna fight 'em off
[00:13.61] A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
[00:19.22] They're gonna rip it off
[00:23.89] Taking their time right behind my back
[00:42.89] 
[00:29.47] And I'm talkin' to myself at night
[00:33.25] Because I can't forget
[00:39.75] Back and forth through my mind
[00:43.41] Behind a cigarette
[00:50.15] And the message comin' from my eyes says, "Leave it alone"
[01:19.15] 
[01:05.50] Don't wanna hear about it
[01:10.98] Every single one's got a story to tell
[01:16.46] Everyone knows about it, yeah
[01:21.59] From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell
[01:45.09] 
[01:27.14] And I catch it comin' 'round my way
[01:31.18] I'm gonna serve it to you
[01:38.32] And that ain't what you wanna' hear
[01:41.75] But that's what I'll do
[01:49.06] And the feeling coming from my bones says, "Find a home"
[02:17.06] 
[02:37.41] I'm going to Wichita
[02:42.75] Far from this opera for evermore
[02:48.65] I'm gonna work the straw
[02:54.23] Make the sweat drip out of every pore
[03:12.73] 
[03:00.18] And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
[03:04.34] Right before the lord
[03:10.59] All the words are gonna bleed from me
[03:14.32] And I will think no more
[03:21.04] And the stains comin' from my blood tell me, "Go back home"
